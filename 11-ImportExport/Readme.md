# React Import and Export Explained 

## Import and Export in React

1. `Default` Export and Import
    - A file can have only `one default export`. 
    - When importing a default export, you can `name it whatever you like`.
2. `Named` Export and Import
    - A file can have `multiple named exports`. Each named exports must be `explicitly exported`.
    - When importing a named export, the import names must match the export name exactlty.
    - Named imports must be enclosed in curly brackets.
3. `Mixed` Export and Import
